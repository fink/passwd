Passwd-core package for the Fink Project
http://www.finkproject.org/

The package passwd-core and its associated splitoffs
are in the Public Domain.

This package provides a unified method by which several administrative user and group
entries can be added to your user database by the various "passwd-*" packages.
These are needed to protect the data of several daemons (e.g. news  server, 
database server, etc.).

USAGE: 
This package installs the "update-passwd" script, which takes arguments in the 
following format:

@PREFIX@/sbin/update-passwd <user name> <description> <home directory> <shell> <group name> <group membership>

In addition, during the install process the package will check whether fink is using
an automatic ID range (the default as of fink-0.33.0) and set itself to match, or will
query the user whether automatic or manual allocation is required.  This setting is saved
in @PREFIX@/etc/passwd.conf.   

UID and GID entries for users can be assigned in several ways:

1)  If there is already a matching user and/or group on the system, it/they will be
regarded as satisfying the requirement.  Examples are:  users/groups installed by 
previous versions of the passwd-* packages, or deployed via a central directory
service.  This is true regardless of the @PREFIX@/etc/passwd.conf setting.

2)  If there is no matching user, then the UID and GID will be either generated dynamically
or via user interaction, depending on the configuration in @PREFIX@/etc/passwd.conf.
