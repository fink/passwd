Administrators can reconfigure @PREFIX@/etc/passwd-fink and @PREFIX@/etc/group-fink
to match their desired UID and GID settings for the various users.  The formats are
as follows.

passwd-fink:

<username>:*:<uid>:<gid>::0:0:<description>:<home directory>:<shell>

group-fink:

<groupname>:*:<gid>:<comma-separated-list-of-users>

<field> denotes a field which can be set by the administrator, and everything
else is mandatory.
